# Elevator Control System 

Mesosphere Distributed Applications Engineer Challenge

## Whole Structure

At first, I don't want to let the "Central Control System" to control every step of the elevators. Each elevator should have it's own way to traversal among the floors.

After control system received a pickup request, control system will ask all elevators the distance away from pickup floor. Every elevator will compute a distance by itself, then response the result to control system. Finally control system will choose the nearest elevator to pickup passenger.

## Data Structures, Algorithms and Design Patterns

- Data Structure: TreeSet
- Algorithms: SCAN
- Design patterns:
	- Observer Design Pattern
		- Not typical Observer Pattern, Just part of it.
		- Elevator will send step() notification after every step. 
	- Strategy Design Pattern
		- Future work for easier change SCAN algorithm to others.
	
## Implement SCAN algorithm

#### Data structure: Two TreeSet(Objects are stored in a sorted and ascending order)

- up-stop-floors(TreeSet): All the floors which elevator will stopped during ascent.
- down-stop-floors(TreeSet): All the floors which elevator will stopped during descent.

#### Compute the distance from elevator to pickup floor:

1. Elevator is IDLE : 
	- Math.abs(currentFloor - pickupFloor) ;
2. Elevator and pickup-request have different direction:
	- Math.abs(currentFloor - destFloor) + 
	- Math.abs(destFloor - pickupFloor) ;
3. Elevator and pickup-request have same direction and elevator not passed:
	- Math.abs(currentFloor - pickupFloor);
4. Elevator and pickup-request have same direction but elevator passed:
	- Math.abs(currentFloor - destFloor) + 
	- Math.abs(destFloor - firstFloor/lastFloor) + 
	- Math.abs(firstFloot/lastFloor - pickupFloor);
 
#### Handle the pickup request: pickup(int pickupFloor, int destFloor)

- pickupFloor == destFloor: return
- pickupFloor - destFloor < 0 ? up : down

1. up: add both pickupFloor and destFloor to up-stop-floors.
2. down: add both pickupFloor and destFloor to down-stop-floors.

## Disadvantages And Future Work:

#### Disadvantages 1:

1. Some elevators may be always more near to passengers then others, which could make some elevators overload meanwhile the others are IDLE.
2. Never consider the capacity of the elevator.

#### Solution 1:

- Use a `score` indicate how much match of a elevator to passenger.

#### Disadvantage 2:

- In this project, all the elevators use the same SCAN algorithm to traverse among the floors. May be different elevators should choose different algorithm.

#### Solution 2:

- Implement 'Strategy Design Pattern' to change algorithm friendly.

### Build Instructions

I leave all the eclipse configuration in repository, so just download the repository and import into eclipse as a java project.

I use JUnit to test the cases include:

- distance of elevator to pickup floor (different scenarios).
- controller assign request to elevator.
- elevator notify every step to controller.
